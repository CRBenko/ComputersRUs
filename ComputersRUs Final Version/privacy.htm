          <br /><strong>Privacy Statement for computersRus </strong
          ><br /><br />This Privacy Policy describes how your personal
          information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a
          purchase from computersrus.com (the "Site").<br /><br /><strong
            >Personal information we collect</strong
          ><br /><br />
          When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
          about your device, including information about your web browser, IP
          address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
          device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information
          about the individual web pages or products that you view, what
          websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
          about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
          automatically-collected information as "Device Information".<br /><br />
          We collect Device Information using the following technologies:<br />
          - "Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or computer
          and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information
          about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
          http://www.allaboutcookies.org.<br />
          - "Log files", and User Accounts, track actions occurring on the Site,
          and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet
          service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.<br />
          - "Web beacons", "tags", and "pixels" are electronic files used to
          record information about how you browse the Site.<br />
          <br />Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a
          purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you,
          including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment
          information (including credit card numbers, email address, and phone
          number. We refer to this information as "Order Information".<br />
          <br /><strong>Personal User Information</strong><br /><br />
          When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we
          are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.<br />
          <br />How do we use your personal information?<br /><br />
          We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any
          orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment
          information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
          and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order
          Information to:<br />
          - Communicate with you;<br />
          - Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and<br />
          - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide
          you with information or advertising relating to our products or
          services.<br />
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
          potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
          generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
          analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site,
          and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising
          campaigns).<br /><br />
          We use your account information that we collect generally to generate
          statistics for you, and provide personalized roadmaps. Additionally,
          we use this information to:<br />
          - Communicate with you;<br />
          - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide
          you with information or advertising relating to our products or
          services.<br />
          <br /><strong>Sharing your personal Information</strong><br /><br />
          We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use
          your Personal Information, as described above.<br />
          For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our
          customers use the Site -- you can read more about how Google uses your
          Personal Information here:
          https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out
          of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.<br />
          We fund our site by showing adverts as you browse our site. These
          adverts are usually managed by a partner specializing in providing
          adverts for multiple sites. Invariably these partners collect
          anonymous data about the websites you visits so they can personalize
          the adverts to you, ensure that you don't see the same adverts too
          frequently and ultimately report to advertisers on which adverts are
          working. We use a third-party to provide monetization technologies for
          our site. You can review their privacy and cookie policy here.<br />
          Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
          applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
          warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to
          otherwise protect our rights.<br /><br />
          <strong>Behavioural advertising</strong><br /><br />
          As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you
          with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe
          may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted
          advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative's
          ("NAI") educational page at
          http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.<br />
          You can opt out of targeted advertising by using the links below:<br />
          - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads<br />
          - Google: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous<br />
          - Bing:
          https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads<br />
          You can get a full list of the partners we use by accessing our
          ads.txt file.<br />
          Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting
          the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out portal at:

          You can learn more about online advertising, or opt-out of almost all
          advertising cookies at https://www.youronlinechoices.com.<br />
          Note: Opting out will not disable ads, they will just no longer be
          tailored to you.<br /><br />

          Please note that we do not alter our Site's data collection and use
